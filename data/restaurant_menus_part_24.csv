Vanilla ice cream and chocolate ice cream with chunks of cookie dough and fudge brownies—it’s hard to imagine a better combination. Ben & Jerry's Half Baked—which got its name because the cookie dough isn’t baked, but the brownies are—has been a bestselling flavor since we first decided to combine our classic ice cream creations back in 2000. Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, with big chunks of chocolate chip cookie dough surrounded by vanilla ice cream, was created back in 1984 at our very first Scoop Shop after we received an anonymous fan’s flavor suggestion. It continues as a flavor phenomenon to this very day. Chocolate Fudge Brownie is a fan-favorite chocolate extravaganza, mixing chocolate ice cream with ridiculously delicious Greyston Bakery brownies. It’s been satisfying chocolate lovers since 1991.

10159,ICE CREAM,B&J CHERRY GARCIA PT,"Cherry ice cream with cherries and fudge flakes. It’s our tribute to guitarist Jerry Garcia and his fans everywhere, and it all started with a piece of fan mail.
 
You see, back in the day, before smartphones and social media, our fans spoke to us via handwritten notes pinned to the bulletin boards at our Scoop Shops. It was sometime in 1986 when one such fan was persistent enough to mail a postcard to our main office in Burlington, Vermont. Super premium ice cream meets great guitar solos? It was genius, and Ben immediately began creating the iconic concoction.
 
Cherry Garcia debuted in 1987 and quickly became one of our top three most popular flavors. In fact, the first eight ice cream pints went straight to Mr. Garcia himself and were met with two thumbs up! As for the fan who sent the anonymous postcard? Our sleuths found her and thanked her with a trip to Vermont and a year’s supply of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream.
 
It’s been a long, strange trip ever since, but what remains is Ben & Jerry's commitment to producing the world’s best frozen desserts in the most responsible way possible.

Stubby) took this great invention even further by adding chocolate coating topped with nuts. One of the brothers' wives said it looked like a fried chicken leg, thus the Drumstick novelty was born!

10159,ICE CREAM,B&J PHISH FOOD PT,"""Chocolate ice cream with gooey marshmallow, caramel swirls and fudge fish. It’s delicious, but how did it come to be? 

Ben had been pondering the lack of a good marshmallow ice cream for years. “Most attempts at marshmallow were wispy. You can see the white streaks, but you can't taste them, you can't feel them, you can't experience the true glorious marshmallowness of it all,” Ben remembers. Well, back in 1995, we suggested to the rock band Phish that we celebrate our shared Vermont, USA, roots by creating a Phish flavor. As the wheel started turning on the collaboration, Ben saw an opportunity to solve the marshmallow conundrum once and for all. Starting with a base of rich chocolate ice cream, he and our flavor gurus started bringing the band test tubs of the evolving concoction. “We ate a lot of test tubs around the table with Phish. We’ve done flavors with other artists and entities, but nobody was more involved in creating the flavor than Phish was,” Jerry says. The band was instrumental, for example, in calling for caramel swirl, an addition that pushed the flavor over the top.

10159,ICE CREAM,B&J COOKIE DOUGH PT,"Big delicious chunks of chocolate chip cookie dough surrounded by creamy vanilla ice cream. It seems like such a no-brainer today, but in 1984 it was revolutionary. The Cookie Dough you know and love started with a simple suggestion: What if you put chunks of chocolate chip cookie dough into vanilla ice cream? That was the amazing anonymous idea submitted way back in the early days of our first Burlington, Vermont, USA, Scoop Shop. We used to have a bulletin board where people could suggest new flavors for Jerry and Ben to make—and this idea stood out. The folks at the Scoop Shop immediately went to work mixing up a batch of Cookie Dough. It was an instant hit. Initially, the flavor was only available at the Scoop Shop. When we decided to sell it in tubs, we had to figure out how to get that familiar cookie-dough taste, consistency and texture at ice cream temperatures. We teamed up with Rhino Foods and, over an incredible six-year journey, we perfected the cookie dough found in our tubs today. In 1991, Cookie Dough began appearing in freezer aisles everywhere. It has remained one of our most popular and beloved flavors ever since!

This taste sensation was suggested by a college student in New Hampshire, way back in 1988. The idea seemed so perfect that we got started on it right away.

10159,GNC,SIX STAR NO FURY 60CT,"THE ULTIMATE PRE-WORKOUT SUPPLEMENT
The driving force behind Six Star® N.O. Fury is a powerful Nitric Oxide Matrix, based on L-arginine and L-citrulline. These two molecules promote the production of NO – nitric oxide – which is a well-known vasodilator. As a result, more blood rushes to your skeletal muscles carrying oxygen and nutrients – and, there’s more blood available to flush out lactic acid buildup associated with post-workout fatigue. Boosting your nitric oxide levels enables you to exercise harder and for longer periods of time, enhances your muscle pumps and improves your recovery.

GET N.O. FURY-OUS: HARNESS THE POWER OF NITRIC OXIDE
Six Star® N.O. Fury is a one-of-a-kind pre-workout that will drive you through your most challenging training sessions like never before. Tapping into the power of nitric oxide, a well-known (and extremely effective) vasodilator, this formula works to expand your blood vessels for harder, fuller muscles and more explosive muscle pumps. Each serving floods your system with a scientifically engineered dose of Nitric Oxide Matrix, delivering a blend of potent ingredients that get to work after your very first dose.

PRE-WORKOUT ENERGY, ENCAPSULATED
Unlike your typical pre-workout powder that requires mixing, Six Star® N.O. Fury is conveniently packed into a ready-to-take pill form. No shaker cup required. Scientifically advanced rapid-release caplets deliver a precise dose of arginine to enhance your nitric oxide levels and deliver rapid vascular expansion for muscle pumps you can see and feel.",15.99 USD

10246,ICE CREAM,B&J COOKIE DOUGH PT,"Big delicious chunks of chocolate chip cookie dough surrounded by creamy vanilla ice cream. It seems like such a no-brainer today, but in 1984 it was revolutionary. The Cookie Dough you know and love started with a simple suggestion: What if you put chunks of chocolate chip cookie dough into vanilla ice cream? That was the amazing anonymous idea submitted way back in the early days of our first Burlington, Vermont, USA, Scoop Shop. We used to have a bulletin board where people could suggest new flavors for Jerry and Ben to make—and this idea stood out. The folks at the Scoop Shop immediately went to work mixing up a batch of Cookie Dough. It was an instant hit. Initially, the flavor was only available at the Scoop Shop. When we decided to sell it in tubs, we had to figure out how to get that familiar cookie-dough taste, consistency and texture at ice cream temperatures. We teamed up with Rhino Foods and, over an incredible six-year journey, we perfected the cookie dough found in our tubs today. In 1991, Cookie Dough began appearing in freezer aisles everywhere. It has remained one of our most popular and beloved flavors ever since!

You see, back in the day, before smartphones and social media, our fans spoke to us via handwritten notes pinned to the bulletin boards at our Scoop Shops. It was sometime in 1986 when one such fan was persistent enough to mail a postcard to our main office in Burlington, Vermont. Super premium ice cream meets great guitar solos? It was genius, and Ben immediately began creating the iconic concoction.
 
Cherry Garcia debuted in 1987 and quickly became one of our top three most popular flavors. In fact, the first eight ice cream pints went straight to Mr. Garcia himself and were met with two thumbs up! As for the fan who sent the anonymous postcard? Our sleuths found her and thanked her with a trip to Vermont and a year’s supply of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream.
 
It’s been a long, strange trip ever since, but what remains is Ben & Jerry's commitment to producing the world’s best frozen desserts in the most responsible way possible.

10246,SCHOOL/STATIONARY,PRNTWRK 100%25RECYCLD REAM400,"Printworks 100%25 Recycled Multipurpose Paper takes the common belief that what's good for the environment needs to be expensive and turns it on its ear. While most economical, recycled papers are made with 30%25 recycled fiber, PrintWorks Recycled Multipurpose Paper is 100%25 recycled, more than 3 times the recycled content but around the same price. Tread lightly on your wallet and the earth for sustainable savings.
About 40 percent of all paper collected for recycling in the United States is sent on a journey of up to 7,000 miles to overseas markets, primarily Asia, where it is remanufactured into paper products, many of which are sent right back to the United States. This round trip, of up to 14,000 miles, creates a vast carbon footprint compared to paper recycled in the United States. PrintWorks 100%25 Recycled copy paper is REMADE right here in the United States!
To reduce costs, PrintWorks 100%25 Recycled printer paper is made from raw materials sourced within 300 miles of the paper mill. This reduces the amount of transport: gas, energy, carbon, required to get the materials from origination to production. When you buy PrintWorks 100%25 Recycled paper, you are helping to keep materials out of landfills and promoting a sustainable earth-friendly process.
At the mill, a proprietary process takes everyday food and beverage containers along with other print materials and separates the poly layer (the shiny stuff that controls temperature and moisture) from the paper layer. The poly is collected and remade into common household goods like composite fencing and decking. The paper that comes from the coffee cups, ice cream containers, soda boxes, and food packages is put through a chlorine-free cleaning, de-inking and re-pulping process to form the basis of this recycled paper.
The performance of PrintWorks 100%25 recycled paper is comparable to all recycled papers and is quality guaranteed for all inkjet and laser printers and copiers. The multipurpose paper is perfect for everyday printing at home, school or in the office.
For over 50 years, we have been the experts on coatings, paper finishes and the total printing process. The Printworks family of multipurpose papers is the perfect choice for a wide variety of printing needs. Whether you are printing recipes, driving directions, school reports or presentations for that I've-got-to-impress business meeting, Printworks has a grade of paper specifically engineered to meet your needs.
